# Introduction

PartyKit simplifies developing multiplayer applications. You no longer need to think about the operational complexity and cost of realtime infrastructure - instead, you can focus on building multiplayer apps or adding realtime experiences to your existing projects with as little as one line of code.

By leveraging the reach of edge computing platforms and novel programming primitives, PartyKit is powerful enough to build the most complex of applications, all the while providing a familiar model.

To learn more, watch Sunil Pai's talk ['Everything is better with friends'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd8QTRjZZaE) from React Miami 2023 or see him implement a multiplayer mode in [a Learn with Jason episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvAzFoaxvAE&t=3418s).

Enough talk, let's get started!

## Key Features

- **customizable**: run your own code on the platform, choose which libraries or abstractions to run; based on your use case or trade-offs, and deploy your own business logic that runs on the platform; for example, if you're building text editing, you can use for example Y.js library - PartyKit will work with the solutions you choose
- **scalable**: leverages edge computing networks to support thousands of users across the planet, intelligently routing and optimizing connections from users without requiring any developer interventions (it will do this for you, you dont need to worry); it scales 10s to 1000s of users
- **just JavaScript**: developers can use familiar language (or optionally wasm) to write the code that runs on the servers
- **batteries included**: PartyKit comes with local dev tools, deploy previews, secret management to work well with your development workflows and your stack
- **intuitive**: simple interface to a powerful platform (no hassle)

## Who's using PartyKit?

- [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org/), an open source block-based rich text editor - see PartyKit in action on their homepage
- [tldraw](https://tldraw.com/), a collaborative digital whiteboard where PartyKit powers the collaborative whiteboard experience
- [Stately](https://stately.ai/), a suite of visual tools for building app logic, which uses PartyKit to run state machines on the edge
